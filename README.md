# ImagEngine
ImagEngine is a simple image search engine using Flickr's apis. Despite the fact that the app has simple features, I tried to showcase best practices in the architectural design.

## Tech/Frameworks used
- Swift
- UIKit
- Protocol-Oriented Programming
- DispatchWork
- I used a pragmatic approach in my architectural design and used Clean Architecture.
